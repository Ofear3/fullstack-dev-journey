Answer in your own words:
-> What is semantic HTML?
-> Why use <header> instead of <div class="header">?
-> How does semantic HTML help with:
-> SEO (Search Engine Optimization)?
-> Accessibility?
-> Code Maintenance?

Answer: 

Definition:
    Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that have meaningful names describing their purpose and content,
    rather than generic containers like <div> or <span>. These elements clearly indicate the role of the content
    to both browsers and developers. This improves readability, structure, and understanding of web pages for
    humans and machines alike. Examples include <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <nav>.

Benefits Comparison:

SEO:

Search engines can better understand the content and structure of a webpage, which can improve ranking.

Important content can be highlighted through proper semantic tags, making indexing more accurate.


Accessibility:

Screen readers and assistive technologies can interpret the content more effectively.

Users with disabilities can navigate and understand the page structure more easily.


Maintenance:

Code is more readable and organized, making updates and debugging faster.

Future developers can quickly understand the purpose of each section without extensive comments.

Structural: <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>
